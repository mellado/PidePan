# PidePan

PidePan is an Android app that allows the user to order fresh bread everyday in a convenient way.

The language used for the application is spanish but it could be translated changing strings.xml files and possibly some others changes.

This was a side project I implemented with the idea of creating a startup but finally I did not manage to get it working. Let me know if you try.
